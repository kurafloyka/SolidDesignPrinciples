# SolidDesignPrinciples

SOLID are a set of principles formulated by Robert C.Martin that are meant to guide developers to design and implement software that is easily maintainable, clear, and scalable. In other words, following these principles helps us to write a more solid software. These five principles are:

The Single Responsibility Principle: A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.
The Open Closed Principle: Software entities should be open to extension but closed to modification.
The Liskov Substitution Principle: Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.
The Interface Segregation Principle: Make fine-grained interfaces that are client specific.
The Dependency Inversion Principle: Depend on abstraction, not on concretion.
